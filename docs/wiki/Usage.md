## System
You must allocate at least `5120mb` of memory to minecraft for the mod to launch.

It is recommended to allocate `8192mb` of memory for playability and reduced launch times.

The more you can give it the best it is.


Alternativily you can disable parts of the mod in the configs to reduce memory usage

(Compressed blocks have heavy impact on memory)
